A weary ###### trudged down the muddy path, its grey coat streaked by rain, braying like some forlorn ###### who’d seen nothing but hurt. The sky reflected its mood—###, brooding clouds that turned the world ####. With each step, the ###### stumbled over slick stones, its patience as battered as the landscape. The villagers whispered of the ### omens carried by this #### beast, calling it stubborn, foolish, and plain ####, yet that same ###### carried their burdens day after day. Even when thrown into the most ### and #### chores, the faithful ###### never stopped, braving each drop of rain and each mocking glance, proving that even a so-called ####, ### ###### can hold unexpected strength.
