Under a crisp winter sky, pale moonlight streamed through bare branches, casting long, soft shadows across the snow‑covered ground. Each breath of cold air carried the faint scent of pine, and the stillness was broken only by the distant rustle of an owl in flight. In the hush of the night, the world felt suspended—silent, vast, and endlessly calm. The scene held a quiet magic, not in sparkling stars or dancing lights, but in the serene expanse of frost and shadow that embraced the landscape.
