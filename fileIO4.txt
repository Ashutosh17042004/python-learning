A ###### trotted through the dusty village lane, its bray echoing before the ###### itself came into view. The ######’s ears twitched at every sound, alert and proud, while villagers paused to greet the friendly ###### as it carried a heavy bundle of firewood. Though some teased the ###### as stubborn, anyone who truly knew the ###### would describe it as patient and dependable—qualities that made the ###### beloved by all.
